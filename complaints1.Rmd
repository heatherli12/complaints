# It is somewhat sloppy to include a read_csv() command in the setup chunk.
# Normally, we would just load libraries here. However, we have not learned
# about the col_types argument to read_csv() yet, so we can't make the annoying
# message go away unless we stick the call in a code chunk with a code chunk
# option like message = FALSE or include = FALSE.

```{r, clean_data}
# First portion of the pipe is the same that we did on Monday. We want to know
# how many complaints each office received.

clean_data <- raw_data %>% 
  group_by(officer_id) %>% 
  summarise(total = n()) %>% 
  
  # We now want to know which percentile (out of 10) each office is in. We could
  # split up this flow into separate pipes, or even separate R code chunks, but
  # keeping it all together is convenient.
  
  mutate(compl_dec = ntile(total, 10)) %>% 
  
  # As you build a pipe, you want to look at the result after each step to make
  # sure it does what you want. Only after it is working would you then assign
  # the result to an object which you can use later.
  
  # For each decile, we want to know the total number of complaints for all the
  # officers in that decile.
  
  group_by(compl_dec) %>% 
  summarize(compl_total = sum(total)) %>% 
  
  # The graph needs total complaints as a percentage, which is easy to
  # calculate. Then, we only keep around the variables we need for the plot.
  
  mutate(compl_perc = compl_total / sum(compl_total)) %>% 
  select(compl_dec, compl_perc)

```{r, plot_data}
# We could just have one giant pipe which goes directly into ggplot(), like we
# do in the tutorials. There is nothing wrong with that approach, but it is
# often easier to split your work up into separate parts, the better to make
# sure that each part is doing what you want.
